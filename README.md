My Protfolio!

This Website is to show the skills I learned in Skillcrush. It also has links to projects I have made along with my linkedin and github.

Link to project: https://elenakath.github.io/profile-1/

How it's made:
Tech used: HTML and CSS 
This site I used HTML to structure the page and add all my info, links and images. I used CSS to add the color and layout. In the CSS I also used flexbox for the layout. 
This website is also responsive, for mobile, tablet and desktop!

Lessons Learned
This was my first site built without any guidance. There were a lot of great learning experiences, especially with flexbox. I have never added a hover to text so that was fun to learn how to use
and I really enjoy the look of it for users. Since I built this on my own it was a fun experience to look at the layout and see where things needed more space or text needed to be bigger.
